# IoT-StepCounter-Project
IoT Project was built using a micro-bit to track step counts. Micro-bit was programmed with Python to track step count and to send eddystone bluetooth to raspberry pi. On the Raspberry Pi side, it calculated predicted step values based on weather data collected through OpenWeatherData API. The Android Application connected to the Raspberry Pi using MQTT broker and gathered  weather data using OpenWeather API. The Android App would then send the weather data to the Raspberry Pi so that it could calculate the predicted step values with the given step count from the microbit and the given weather data from the android app. The predicted value was calculated based on a simple linear regression formula. Once the predicted value was calculated, the value is then passed to the android app to display a message to the user indicating whether they met their predicted value goal or not. There is also a data visualization component to this android application, where it will show daily step counts in a bar graph
